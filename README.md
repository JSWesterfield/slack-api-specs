# slack-api-specs

This repository contains API specifications of Slack platform features and APIs. Currently, it contains a single spec for the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/web).

Read more about our open specification strategy in [this announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/standard-practice-slack-web-openapi-spec-daaad18c7f8).

Because our specifications are an artifact, we cannot accept pull requests for this repo. Please file issues with suggestions or bugs with the spec itself. Feedback about the APIs or features the specs describe should be directed to Slack's [developer support team](mailto:feedback@slack.com).

Each platform feature with one or more API specs available can be found in their own subdirectory. You'll find only `web-api` today and it contains a single OpenAPI 2.0 specification. Additional specs and spec types are on the way.
